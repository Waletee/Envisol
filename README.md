Iâ€™m Taiwo Abiodun by name and i hail from Nigeria, Africa. Prior to enrolling for Software Engineering with ALX I had no experience with coding or computer programming. I am always enthusiastic about technology which made me learn how to install and service electronic security equipments, before adding IT support to what I do. I have a passion for creating products that connect, enhance and empower others. I used my learn't skills on the back-end and front-end to create Envisol.
